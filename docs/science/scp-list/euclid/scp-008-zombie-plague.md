**SCP 008, also known as “Zombie Plague”** is a biohazardous Euclid anomaly, and is an airborne infection. Should a human be infected with SCP-008 or by an instance of SCP-008, they will turn into a zombie. There have been 3 reported types of zombies, each with their own properties and effects, which are listed below. SCP-008 is preventable through biohazard suits or gas masks, of which are provided to ScD Personnel, and MTF Personnel. Should one become infected, they tend to lose all common sense, and will begin to spread the virus to non-infected members.&#x20;

:::danger MANDATE
It is mandated that all Personnel wear their hazmat suit when testing on SCP-008 and in the case of a breach. When wearing the hazmat suit, you are immune to the effects of SCP-008.

## Different Gasses

SCP-008 has a control panel in which 3 different gasses can be released individually or in unison with one another. Each gas has different properties, and resulting anomalous changes to its subjected victims.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="SCP-008-1" label="SCP-008-1" default>
This iteration of SCP-008 will turn members who inhale this gas into what we call "standard zombies". They will appear as your stereotypical zombie, which you'd find in a horror film. With green skin, and below average motor control, they will begin to chase Personnel in efforts to spread the infection. They do not appear to be any faster than an average person, and exhibit no supernatural abilities or effects.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="SCP-008-2" label="SCP-008-2" default>
This gas will cause infected persons to become smaller or shorter than the average height, which is about 3 feet tall. They are capable of running at faster speeds than the average person, however they are easier to terminate as they have less health than SCP-008-1 instances.&#x20;
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="SCP-008-3" label="SCP-008-3" default>
SCP-008-3 will cause infected persons to become larger than the average human, about 9-10 feet tall. Instances who have been infected with SCP-008-3 are slower than the average person, and are easily avoided. However, the infected members do show a greater resistance to damage than the other 2 instances, and thus require more force to take down.
