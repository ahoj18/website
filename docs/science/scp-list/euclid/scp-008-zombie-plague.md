**SCP 008, also known as “Zombie Plague”** is a biohazardous Euclid anomaly. SCP 008 is an airborne infection. Should a human be infected with 008, they will die instantaneously. The deceased will then revive into a zombie-like creature. These “Zombies” resemble rotting corpses, and have a unique walking style. The infected remain just as physically able as they did when they were alive, and don’t seem to gain any ill-effects from their rotting bodies. Infected Personnel are reported to lose motor control, and as a consequence, have a slower movement speed. Individuals become very hostile, and will attempt to spread 008 via touch. Biohazard suits have proven effective in preventing the spread of 008.

## Different Gasses

SCP-008 has a control panel in which 3 different gasses can be released individually or in unison with one another. Each gas has different properties, and resulting anomalous changes to its subjected victims.
